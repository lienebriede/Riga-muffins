This is a simple webpage for a muffin shop, but can be used for any other small shop, bakery or cafe that offers a limited selection of goods.  It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices.

-   ### Design
    
    #### Colour Scheme
    The colors used (besides black and white) are soft-pink and lemon-yellow. Transparent dark grey is used as the background color for white texts. 
    
    #### Typography
    The main font used for this webpage is Poppins with Sans Serif as the fallback font. Poppins is simple, attractive and used frequently in programming. The other font that is used is Bangers. It is a comic book font and stands out, so it is used only for the logo. The fallback font is cursive.
    #### Imagery
    Images are very important for this page, they catch the user's attention and function as marketing for the shop. They also represent the shop and the products the shop offers. 


## Features

### Navigation Bar
Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the logo (links to "Home"), "Home", "Our Products" and "Franchising" pages. It is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation. For devices sized 1024px and larger, hover selector is used on the menu lists elements.

Navigation bar on mobile devices includes a logo with a link to the "Home" page and a hamburger icon, which opens the menu list when clicked.

The choice to make the navigation bar transparent was made so the picture can still be seen in the background.

### Hero Image
Different hero images are used on pages "Home" and "Our Products" to draw the users' attention and make them want to purchase the products. The cover texts on the hero images function as marketing for the shop.

### Wireframes

## Testing

- The [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers. It was also tested on a variety of devices using [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/).

- The Website was tested using [Google Chrome Lighthouse Tool](https://github.com/lienebriede/Riga-muffins/index.html). The Accessability score on pages "Home" and "Franchising" is 100, and 98 on the page "Our products".

- Friends were asked to review the site and give feedback.

### Issues

Since this page does not represent an existing shop, and therefore there is no logo for the shop, a Heading2 (font: Bangers) was used for the text - RIGA MUFFINS. Thus Headings are not displayed in a logical order on the "Our products" page.
